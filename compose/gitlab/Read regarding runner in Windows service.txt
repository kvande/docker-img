In case of running a gitlab runner as windows service (not in docker):

The runner will try to check out (git) from http://127.0.0.1:80 since it does
not know about the port mapping in docker-compose. In order for this to
take the correct port into account the clone_url has to be set, as below:
 

This is the complete setup, note the clone_url:


concurrent = 1
check_interval = 0

[session_server]
  session_timeout = 1800

[[runners]]
  name = "jalla"
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:5123/"
  clone_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5123/"
  token = "abc12890128910201982"
  executor = "shell"
  shell = "powershell"
  [runners.custom_build_dir]
  [runners.cache]
    [runners.cache.s3]
    [runners.cache.gcs]
